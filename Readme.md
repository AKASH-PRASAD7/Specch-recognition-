# Speech Recognition - Audio to Text Conversion

This project is a speech recognition application that converts audio files into text. It utilizes a machine learning model to perform the conversion and provides a simple web interface for users to upload audio files and receive the corresponding text output.

## Features

- Audio file upload: Users can upload audio files in various formats.
- Speech-to-text conversion: The application employs a machine learning model to convert the audio files into text.
- Real-time processing: The conversion process happens in real-time, allowing users to receive the text output quickly.
- Simple web interface: The frontend of the application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide an intuitive and user-friendly experience.
- Node.js server: The application is backed by a Node.js server using the Express framework to handle file uploads, process audio files, and serve the web interface.

## Requirements

To run this application locally, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

- Node.js (version 10 or above)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the source code as a ZIP file.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project's root directory.
3. Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

1. Start the server by running the following command:

```bash
node server.js
```

2. Once the server is running, open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
3. You should see the web interface where you can upload an audio file.
4. Click on the "Choose File" button to select an audio file from your computer.
5. After selecting the file, click on the "Upload" button to initiate the conversion process.
6. The application will process the audio file and display the corresponding text output on the web page.

## Configuration

The application does not require any specific configuration. However, you may adjust certain parameters or settings according to your needs. Here are some possible modifications:

- **Port**: By default, the application runs on port 3000. You can change this by modifying the `PORT` constant in the `server.js` file.
- **Model selection**: If you have different speech recognition models available, you can modify the code in `server.js` to use a different model or specify additional parameters for the existing model.
